# Project 1 - CPTR 440

Project Group Blanka


This project is currently using Python 3.8.5

To Run tests navigate to src

Once in the desired direcory run python main.py or python3 main.py depending on how your enviroment is configureds. It should run all of the tests.

Each Question has its own module and the name of the module directs you to the question. 
You should also find the question and neccesary resources in the module.

The tests.py file is doing the testing. You can click on it and see what's happening, and edit the tests.

If you only want to run a certain number of tests, go to main.py, 
and comment out the set or questions that you don't want to see.

Even though we no longer have to answer set one and two, I left them there in case we have to work on them for another project
