# Project 1 - CPTR 440

Project Group Blanka


This project runs using Python 3.8.5

To Run tests navigate to the src directory.

Once in the src direcory run python main.py or python3 main.py depending on how your enviroment is configured. The tests for set 1 should run.

Each Question has its own module. You can find each question and answer in the set_one directory.
You should also find the question and neccesary resources in the module.

The tests.py file is doing the testing. You can click on it and see what's happening, and edit the tests.

If you only want to run a certain number of tests, go to main.py, 
and comment out the set or questions that you don't want to see.

Actual tests are in tests.py

Even though we no longer have to answer set two and three, I left them there in case we have to work on them for another project
