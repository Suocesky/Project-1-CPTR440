Final Report

We were able to finish questions one through five in set one, and build a testing framework for the assignment. We also built a testing framework for set two and set3 before the assignment was changed, and we started on question 6 but we did not finish it. 

There were a couple of things that made these challenges difficult. Both of us had little experience in converting and manipulating bytes in python so it took us a little bit of time to find the proper commands, functions, and libraries that were useful to us. We also had a bit of trouble when we started working on question three; we didn't understand what we were supposed to do conceptually, but we were able to get back on track after talking to you.

The programming langauge choice affected us in a couple of differerent ways. First, I think that the actual code was easier in python than it would have been if we had chosen C++ because of the easy to find and access libraries, but we also have had more experience working with C++ so it took us awhile longer to become comfortable with the assignment.

We found easter eggs in both questions one and two; if you run the tests, the easter eggs that we found will print, but they mostly involve hidden messages when converting between bytes, hex, base64, and ascii. 

I think that we would stick with python if we continued on with challenges similar to this, and the project also gave us more experience with python libraries, and just coding in general. If we needed to code in python again, I think that we would be overall more comfortable. As far as safety in programming we might be able to use some of these concepts to make our data a bit safer(at least at a glance), and we definetely have more experience converting between different encodings now which could be useful in the future.  

This project has changed how we both look at encryption. Even cracking basic XOR encryptions can take awhile to solve when you are coding it from scratch. Cracking encryption also takes a lot of CPU resources because it took almost a minute for our computers to solve question 4; this also highlights the importance of good code.
