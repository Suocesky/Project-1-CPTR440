# Detect AES in ECB mode
# In this file are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.
# One of them has been encrypted with ECB.
# Detect it.
# Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; 
# the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.
